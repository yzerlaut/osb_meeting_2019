Title: How model standardization underpins new tools in neuroscientific research
Short Title: OSB 2019 Presentation
Author: Neuroinformatics group, CNRS Gif sur Yvette, France

* Motivation

Within this session dedicated to the building and sharing of neuronal models, I will present how this fits into a , the Human Brain Project.

Many of you are familiar with the project, I'll briefly come back to the specific goals and methods of this collaborative effort.



the contribution of our group and collaborators in the standardization of neuronal models and I will also present some new tools that managed to be implemented as a result of those constaints, those "standards".



* Overview:

I will present the contribution of our group and collaborators in the standardization of neuronal models and I will also present some new tools that managed to be implemented as a result of those constaints, those "standards".

The talk will successively present those two aspects:
I) What are the current developments in model standardization, both in terms of model building as well as in the release process of the model (sharing)
II) What are the resulting new tools that followed in terms of model validation and model implementation. In particular this presentation will highlight the tools that are developed in the framework of the Human Brain Project.


* Model standardization: model formatting and release 

** pyNN:

The first effort of the group toward standardized neuronal model is pyNN. pyNN is a simulator-independent language for building network models. 

PyNN provides a library of:
- neuronal model
- (kinetic) synaptic models 
- synaptic plasticity models
- connectivity schemes

PyNN allows to run simulations on different supports (currently NEURON, NEST and Brian) as well as a number of neuromorphic hardware systems (see part 2 of the talk).

** Sonata

An important trend in recent neuroscientific research is the analysis of large-scale simulations of neural dynamics. Such research introduces specific constraints in the design and implementation of numerical simulations. 

To meet the requirement of representing biophysical and point neuron circuits, the SONATA Data Format has been proposed by the Blue Brain Project and the Allen Institute for Brain Science.
 -> optimized for performance for simulation, analysis and visualization of *large-scale* circuits
