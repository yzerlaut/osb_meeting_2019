Title: How model standardization underpins new tools in neuroscientific research

Author: Neuroinformatics group, CNRS Gif sur Yvette, France

* Abstract

Within this session dedicated to the building and sharing standardised neuronal models, I will present the contribution of our group in the standardizaztion of neuronal models and I will also present some new tools that managed to be implemented as a result of those "standards". I will successively present the two following aspects:
1) What are the current developments in model standardization, both in terms of model implementation as well as in the release process of the model
2) What are the resulting new tools that followed in terms of for model validation and model implementation, those tools were in the framework of the Human Brain Project


* Intro & Overview:

Within this session dedicated to the building and sharing standardised neuronal models, I will first present the contribution of our group in the standardizaztion of neuronal models and I will also present some new tools that managed to be implemented as a result of those constaints, those "standards".

So I will successively present the two following aspects:
1) What are the current developments in model standardization, both in terms of model implementation as well as in the release process of the model
2) What are the resulting new tools that followed in terms of for model validation and model implementation, those tools were in the framework of the Human Brain Project


* Model standardization: model formatting and release 

** pyNN:

The first effort toward standardized neuronal model is pyNN. pyNN is a simulator-independent language for building network models. 

PyNN provides a library of:
- standard neuronal model
- (kinetic) synaptic models 
- synaptic plasticity models
- connectivity schemes

PyNN allows to run simulations on different supports (currently NEURON, NEST and Brian) as well as a number of neuromorphic hardware systems (see part 2of the talk).

PyNN.Sonata -> 

SONATA Data Format: A common data model for representing biophysical and point neuron circuits proposed by the AIBS and BBP
 -> optimized for performance for simulation, analysis and visualization of large-scale circuits

The need has arisen at both the Blue Brain Project (BBP) and the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) for efficient ways of representing circuits of neurons (composed of biophysically detailed neuron and point-neuron models) and the output of simulation thereof for analysis and visualization. Such representations are not generally available as open-source tools in the computational neuroscience community, so both the BBP and AIBS have developed internally their own representations to meet these needs. As the public release of these circuits is on both the AIBS and BBP roadmaps, it is desirable to converge on a data model to release these circuits, so as to provide a foundation to foster an emerging ecosystem of tools around the data model, developed by the AIBS, BBP and the community at large.

The objective of this document is to specify a common data model for neural circuits and simulation output which can be used and supported in the future by both AIBS and BBP. The data model will be novel compared to other community approaches (e.g. NeuroML) in that it will be optimized for performance for simulation, analysis and visualization of large-scale circuits. This document is accompanied by an example network in the presented data format.
